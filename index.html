                <h1>About me.</h1>
                <p>I'm an engineer in the field of construction with a broad interest in science and technology. During my education we had some basic courses C++. I found out that I kind of enjoyed programming but I couldn't spend more time on it back then. Luckily I was running Linux on my home laptop so not everything I learned was lost as I could use the basic skill for some scripting.</p>
                <p>Now that I'm graduated and have a job, I have time during weekends and holidays. No more endless studying. My interest in code sparked again but I also wanted to be a bit creative. This is where web design and development enters the picture. I can play around with code that's relatively easy to learn, be somewhat creative and actually build something useful while learning.</p>

                <h1>Goals</h1>
                    <p>My goal is to be able to make static websites with design, usability and mobile devices in mind.</p>
                    <p>I've alse gained some more interest in Javascript and Node.js. Being able to learn backend web development with the same language is a big plus for me.</p>

                <h1>My tools and sources</h1>
                <p>As mentioned before I'm running Linux. I've spent some years
                trying various distros, WM's and DE's. Right now I'm running
                Arch Linux. I'm having fun with thinkering and configuring the
                system, trying not to break anything.</p>
                <p>I'm using vim as my text editor with various plugins:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>ctrlp</li>
                  <li>html5</li>
                  <li>jedi-vim</li>
                  <li>nerdtree</li>
                  <li>node</li>
                  <li>syntastic</li>
                  <li>tern for vim</li>
                  <li>vim-airline</li>
                  <li>vim-autoclose</li>
                  <li>vim-multiple-cursors</li>
