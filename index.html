                <h1>About me.</h1>
                <p>I'm an engineer in the field of construction with a broad interest in science and technology. During my education we had some basic courses C++. I found out that I kind of enjoyed programming but I couldn't spend more time on it back then. Luckily I was running Linux on my home laptop so not everything I learned was lost as I could use the basic skill for some scripting.</p>
                <p>Now that I'm graduated and have a job, I have time during weekends and holidays. No more endless studying. My interest in code sparked again but I also wanted to be a bit creative. This is where web design and development enters the picture. I can play around with code that's relatively easy to learn, be somewhat creative and actually build something useful while learning.</p>

                <h1>Goals</h1>
                    <p>My goal is to be able to make static websites with design, usability and mobile devices in mind. I'm not aiming for some complex website or webapp with an underlying server structure. I'm not a programmer and I'm not an artist. Where both worlds meet, that's the sweet spot for me.<br>Simple, effective and beautiful.</p>

                <h1>My tools and sources</h1>
                <p>As mentioned before I'm running Linux. I've spent some years trying various distros, WM's and DE's. Eventually I settled with Ubuntu and Unity. I like the look, feel and work flow of Unity and Ubuntu lets me do my thing without to much tinkering and maintenance. Bare bones distros are fun but in the end I spent more time tinkering than working.</p>
                <p>I picked Brackets as my editor, it's open source and multi platform. The same things apply here: I like the work flow, look and feel of this editor. Integrated auto complete for html, css and JavaScript is nice and so is the integrated project tree.
